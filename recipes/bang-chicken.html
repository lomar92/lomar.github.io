    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      This bang bang chicken is a wonderful Americanized version of an extremely
      popular Sichuan Chinese dish. With twice-fried chicken, you get the crispy
      fried breading you'd expect, and the bang bang sauce drizzle makes the
      entire dish spectacular. You'll love this more than any restaurant
      version. Pay attention to the notes in the directions.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>⅓ cup milk</li>
      <li>1 large egg</li>
      <li>1 pound boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into 1-inch cubes</li>
      <li>¼ cup potato starch</li>
      <li>¼ cup all-purpose flour</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon shichimi togarashi (Japanese red pepper condiment)</li>
      <li>2 cups oil for frying, or as needed</li>
      <li>¼ cup mayonnaise</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons honey</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons sweet chili sauce</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon gochujang (Korean hot pepper paste)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Whisk together milk and egg in a large bowl until well combined. Add
        chicken; stir to coat and allow to marinate for 15 minutes. Drain and
        discard egg mixture.
      </li>
      <li>
        Combine potato starch, flour, salt, pepper, and shichimi in a medium
        bowl. Pour into a large plastic resealable bag. Add chicken; seal the
        bag and shake until chicken is well coated.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat 2 inches oil in a deep saucepan over medium heat to 325 degrees F
        (165 degrees C).
      </li>
      <li>
        Working in batches of about 5 to 8 pieces at a time, cook chicken in hot
        oil for about 90 seconds. Remove to a paper towel-lined plate; keep each
        batch separate.
      </li>
      <li>
        Increase oil temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). The oil
        should be continuously boiling at this point. Carefully re-add the first
        batch of chicken and fry for another 90 seconds. Remove to another paper
        towel-lined plate. Repeat with remaining batches of chicken.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mix together mayonnaise, honey, sweet chili sauce, and gochujang in a
        large serving bowl until combined. Toss fried chicken with sauce to
        coat.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h3><em>Tips</em></h3>
    <p>
      <em
        >You can substitute potato starch for cornstarch if desired. Potato
        starch is regularly used in Asian cuisine because it has a silkier feel
        and takes on a neutral flavor. You can use any ground red pepper instead
        of shichimi togarashi. You can use any hot sauce instead of gochujang.
        It's beneficial to have a splatter screen if frying the chicken on the
        stovetop. The reason for twice-frying is that it's the secret to
        crispier fried chicken!</em
